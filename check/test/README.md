# Flutter Test

Runs Flutter tests with optional coverage reporting and optionally deployment to GitHub Pages or artifacts.

## Usage

### Basic

```yaml
- name: Test
  uses: Spaccesi/flutter-actions-suite/check/test@main
```

### With Coverage Report & Deployment

```yaml
- name: Test with Coverage
  uses: Spaccesi/flutter-actions-suite/check/test@main
  with:
    run-coverage: 'true'
    deploy-report: 'github-pages' # or 'artifact' or 'none'
    github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Inputs

| Input | Description | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dart-define` | Command line arguments for `String.fromEnvironment`. | No | `''` |
| `dart-define-from-file` | Path to a `.json` or `.env` file for environments. | No | `''` |
| `flavor` | App flavor to use when running tests. | No | `''` |
| `concurrency` | Number of concurrent test processes. | No | `1` |
| `timeout` | Test timeout (e.g., `60s`, `2x`, `none`). | No | `60s` |
| `ignore-timeouts` | Ignore all timeouts. | No | `false` |
| `run-coverage` | Collect coverage (forces `lcov.info` generation). | No | `false` |

## What It Does

1. Runs `flutter test .` with configured options.
2. Uses the GitHub reporter for rich logging.
3. If coverage is enabled (or `deploy-report` is set), appends `--coverage`.
4. If a report is requested, it installs `lcov`, runs `genhtml`, and:
    - Deploys to the `gh-pages` branch using `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages`.
    - OR uploads the HTML report as a GitHub artifact named `coverage-report`.

## Workspaces & Monorepos

This action runs tests from the current working directory. In monorepos, use a matrix strategy to run tests for different packages.
